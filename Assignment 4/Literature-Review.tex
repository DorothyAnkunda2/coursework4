\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{INTRODUCTION}
\paragraph{•}
Fire base is Google's mobile and web app development platform that provides developers with a plethora of tools and services to help them develop high-quality apps, grow their user base, and earn more profit.
\subsection{HISTORY}
\paragraph{•}
Fire base evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve provided developers an API that enables the integration of on line chat functionality into their websites. After releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to pass application data that weren't chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in real time across their users.
Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it. They founded Fire base as a separate company
in April 2012.
